This project was created to test the newly implemented website for the company APS Energia SA (www.apsenergia.pl). Tests included verification of all functionalities of the website and its usability for several user and stakeholders groups.

APS Energia operates, among others, in the field of guaranteed power supply systems for industry, generation and transmission of electricity, oil and natural gas.

Responsible for conducting, planning and reporting on the tests was Pawel Kulfan. My testing experience is limited, this is my first project carried out independently, and the substantive basis is the knowledge gathered during the Manual Tester Course at CodersLab, preparation for the ISTQB exam and basic knowledge from the field of UX. However, I've got a very good knowledge of the company, its needs and processes.
